// AutumnFall: Pull-Up Workout Tracker
//
// AutumnFall is an iOS app designed to help you track your pull-up workouts 
// using your device’s camera and Apple’s Vision framework.
// Set your goals, let the app guide your setup, and watch your progress!
//
// Features:
// - Pull-Up Goal Setting: Enter your desired number of pull-ups before each session.
// - Camera Bar Setup: Use the camera to mark your pull-up bar’s location for accurate tracking.
// - Automatic Rep Counting: The app tracks your body movement using computer vision and counts each successful pull-up.
// - Workout Summary: See your performance right after each session, including rep count, time, and goal status.
// - Stats & History: Visualize progress with charts and review your streaks and workout history.
//
// How It Works:
// 1. Set Your Goal: Enter how many pull-ups you want to do.
// 2. Bar Setup: Take a photo and tap both ends of your pull-up bar.
// 3. Get Ready: The app tracks your wrists and waits for you to align with the bar.
// 4. Start Pull-Ups: The timer begins; reps are counted automatically.
// 5. View Results: After finishing, see your summary and stats.
//
// Technologies Used:
// - SwiftUI for user interface and navigation
